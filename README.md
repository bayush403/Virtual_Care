# Virtual Care
Welcome to the repository of the project Virtual Care :green_heart: 

Before you start running your mind to guess what does the project relate to, go through this link first and have a read

# Why should you care?

Because even if you are in a happy state of mind, you should care because your loved ones can have to deal with mental disorders. You should care because you live in a society and human beings are a social animal thriving due to each other's support. Gun violence, terrorism, and Suicide can all be traced back to some sort of mental sickness :pensive:. 

And then you want to live in a happier world, don't you?

# How does our solution fit into all this?

We researched and found out that our lifestyle plays a colossal role in our mental health. Enjoying life, Physical exercises, Yoga, Food, Music, and even the content you consume plays a hefty role in how you feel in your life; in the long run, it decides your mental state, success, and happiness in a relationship. As long as these elements maintain that sweet spot in your lifestyle, you might never even face any mental health issues and if you are facing some already, they will help you to come out of it quickly.

Ha, we know that you have already heard that somewhere, so let's get to the point! :ok_woman:

We built you a buddy or a girlfriend/boyfriend (only if you are single XD) which will always be present for you, right in your mobile. Someone who won't judge you, rather just show you the coolest things on Earth (and maybe Neptune as well; could get too cold), someone that will teach you good habits like exercising, eating a healthy diet and laughing. But whatever it does, it will be selflessly present to improve the quality of your life. :sunflower:

It also has a chatting section with which you can get in contact with any professionals if it is required :)

# How was it built? :wrench:

**Hardware** - Only your mobile! That's what makes it so practical and scalable. Just install the app and feel the power.

**Programming Languages** - Dart.

**Tools** - Flutter, Firebase.


# Features in the Future - :yum:

We plan to add a live face recognition feature that will automatically detect the user's mood from their facial expression and provide a more dynamic content based on the changing mood of the user.
